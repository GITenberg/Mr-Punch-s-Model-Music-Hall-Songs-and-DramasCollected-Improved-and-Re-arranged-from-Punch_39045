<h2><a name="INTRODUCTION" id="INTRODUCTION"></a>INTRODUCTION.</h2>


<p><span class="smcap">The</span> day is approaching, and may even now be
within measurable distance, when the Music Halls
of the Metropolis will find themselves under yet more
stringent supervision than is already exercised by
those active and intelligent guardians of middle-class
morality, the London County Council. The moral
microscope which detected latent indecency in the
pursuit of a butterfly by a marionette is to be provided
with larger powers, and a still more extended
field. In other words, our far-sighted and vigilant
County Councilmen, perceiving the futility of delaying
the inspection of Variety Entertainments until
such improprieties as are contained therein have
been suffered to contaminate the public mind for a considerable
period, are determined to nip these poison-flowers
in the bud for the future; and, unless Mr.
Punch is misinformed, will apply to Parliament at
the earliest opportunity for clauses enabling them to
require each item in every forthcoming performance<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span>
to be previously submitted to a special committee for
sanction and approval.</p>

<p>The conscientious rigour with which they will discharge
this new and congenial duty may perhaps be
better understood after perusing the little prophetic
sketch which follows; for Mr. Punch's Poet, when not
employed in metrical composition, is a Seer of some
pretensions in a small way, and several of his predictions
have already been shamelessly plagiarised by
the unscrupulous hand of Destiny. It is not improbable
that this latest effort of his will receive a
similar compliment, although this would be more
gratifying if Destiny ever condescended to acknowledge
such obligations. However, here is the forecast
for what it is worth, a sum of incalculable amount:&mdash;</p>


<h3>POETIC LICENCES.</h3>

<h5>A VISION OF THE NEAR FUTURE.</h5>

<blockquote><p class="pim"><span class="smcap">Scene</span>&mdash;<i>A Committee-room of the L. C. C.; Sub-Committee of
Censors, (appointed, under new regulations, to report on
all songs intended to be sung on the Music-hall Stage,)
discovered in session.</i></p></blockquote>

<p class="pi"><i>Mr. Wheedler</i> (<i>retained for the Ballad-writers</i>). The next
licence I have to apply for is for&mdash;well, (<i>with some hesitation</i>)&mdash;a
composition which certainly borders on the&mdash;er&mdash;amorous&mdash;but
I think, Sir, you will allow that it is treated in a purely
pastoral and Arcadian spirit.</p>

<p class="pi"><i>The Chairman</i> (<i>gravely</i>). There <i>are</i> arcades, Mr.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[5]</a></span>
Wheedler, I may remind you, which are by no means pastoral.
I cannot too often repeat that we are here to fulfil the mission
entrusted to us by the Democracy, which will no longer
tolerate in its entertainments anything that is either vulgar,
silly, or offensive in the slightest degree.      <span class="p2">[<i>Applause.</i></span></p>

<p class="pi"><i>Mr. Wheedler.</i> Quite so. With your permission, Sir, I
will read you the Ballad.           <span class="p2">[<i>Reads.</i></span></p>


<h4>"MOLLY AND I.</h4>

<p><span class="p4">"Oh! the day shall be marked in red letter&mdash;&mdash;"</span></p>

<p class="pi"><i>The Chairman.</i> One moment, Mr. Wheedler, (<i>conferring
with his colleagues</i>). "Marked with red letter"&mdash;isn't that
a little&mdash;eh? liable to&mdash;&mdash;You don't think they'll have
read Hawthorne's book? Very well, then. Go on, Mr.
Wheedler, please.</p>

<p class="pi"><i>Mr. W.</i> <span class="p1">"'Twas warm, with a heaven so blue."</span></p>

<p class="pi"><i>First Censor.</i> Can't pass those two epithets&mdash;you must
tone them down, Mr. Wheedler&mdash;<i>much</i> too suggestive!</p>

<p class="pi"><i>Mr. W.</i> That shall be done.</p>

<p class="pi"><i>The Chairman.</i> And it ought to be "sky."</p>

<p class="pi">
<i>Mr. W.</i>  <span class="p1">"When amid the lush meadows I met her,</span><br />
<span class="p8">My Molly, so modest and true!"</span>
</p>

<p class="pi"><i>Second Censor.</i> I object to the word "lush"&mdash;a direct
incitement to intemperance!</p>

<p class="pi"><i>Mr. W.</i> I'll strike it out. (<i>Reads.</i>)</p>

<p>
<span class="p4">"Around us the little kids rollicked,</span><br />
<span class="p4">Lighthearted were all the young lambs&mdash;&mdash;"</span>
</p>

<p class="pi"><i>Second Censor.</i> Surely "kids" is <i>rather</i> a vulgar expression,
Mr. Wheedler? Make it "<i>children</i>," and I've no objection.</p>

<p class="pi"><i>Mr. W.</i> I have made it so. (<i>Reads.</i>)</p>

<p>
<span class="p4">"They kicked up their legs as they frolicked"&mdash;&mdash;</span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span></p>

<p class="pi"><i>Third Censor.</i> If that is intended to be done on the stage,
I protest most strongly&mdash;a highly indecorous exhibition!      <span class="p2">[<i>Murmurs of approval.</i></span></p>

<p class="pi"><i>Mr. W.</i> But they're only lambs!</p>

<p class="pi"><i>Third Censor.</i> Lambs, indeed! We are determined to
put down <i>all</i> kicking in Music-hall songs, no matter <i>who</i> does
it! Strike that line out.</p>

<p class="pi"><i>Mr. W.</i> (<i>reading</i>). <span class="p1">"And frisked by the side of their
dams."</span></p>

<p class="pi"><i>First Censor</i> (<i>severely</i>). No profanity, Mr. Wheedler, <i>if</i>
you please!</p>

<p class="pi"><i>Mr. W.</i> Er&mdash;I'll read you the Refrain. (<i>Reads, limply.</i>)</p>

<p class="p4">
<span class="p1">"Molly and I. With nobody nigh.</span><br />
<span class="p2">Hearts all a-throb with a rapturous bliss,</span><br />
<span class="p1">Molly was shy. And (at first) so was I,</span><br />
<span class="p2">Till I summoned up courage to ask for a kiss!"</span>
</p>

<p class="pi"><i>The Chairman.</i> "Nobody nigh," Mr. Wheedler? I don't
quite like that. The Music Hall ought to set a good example
to young persons. "Molly and I&mdash;<i>with her chaperon by</i>," is
better.</p>

<p class="pi"><i>Second Censor.</i> And that last line&mdash;"asking for a kiss"&mdash;does
the song state that they were formally engaged, Mr.
Wheedler?</p>

<p class="pi"><i>Mr. W.</i> I&mdash;I believe it omits to mention the fact. But
(<i>ingeniously</i>) it does not appear that the request was complied
with.</p>

<p class="pi"><i>Second Censor.</i> No matter&mdash;it should never have been
made. Have the goodness to alter that into&mdash;well, something
of this kind. "And I always addressed her politely as
"Miss." Then we <i>may</i> pass it.</p>

<p class="pi"><i>Mr. W.</i> (<i>reading the next verse</i>).</p>

<p>

<p class="pi"><i>Second C.</i> And I don't know&mdash;but I rather fancy there's a
"double-intender" in that word "light"&mdash;(<i>to colleague</i>)&mdash;it
strikes me&mdash;eh?&mdash;what do <i>you</i> think?&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p class="pi"><i>The Chairman</i> (<i>in a conciliatory manner</i>). I am inclined to
agree to some extent&mdash;not that I consider the words particularly
objectionable in themselves, but we are men of the
world, Mr. Wheedler, and as such we cannot shut our eyes to
the fact that a Music-hall audience is only too apt to find
significance in many apparently innocent expressions and
phrases.</p>

<p class="pi"><i>Mr. W.</i> But, Sir, I understood from your remarks recently<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span>
that the Democracy were strongly opposed to anything in the
nature of suggestiveness!</p>

<p class="pi"><i>The Ch.</i> Exactly so; and therefore we cannot allow their

and you, Mr. Wheedler, must either ford the stream like
ordinary persons, or stay where you are.</p>

<p class="pi"><i>Mr. W.</i> (<i>depressed</i>). I may as well read the last verse, I
suppose:</p>

<p class="p4">
"Then under the flickering willow<br />

<p class="pi"><i>First Censor.</i> We can't have that. It is really <i>not</i>
respectable.</p>

<p class="pi"><i>The Ch.</i> (<i>pleasantly</i>). Can't we alter it slightly? "I'd
brought a small portable pillow." No objection to <i>that</i>!</p>

<blockquote><p class="right">[<i>The other Censors express dissent in undertones.</i></p></blockquote>

<p class="pi">
<i>Mr. W.</i>    <span class="p1">"Till I owned that I longed for a drink."</span>
</p>

<p class="pi"><i>Third C.</i> No, no! "A drink"! We all know what <i>that</i>
means&mdash;alcoholic stimulant of some kind. At all events
that's how the audience are certain to take it.</p>

</p>

<p class="pi"><i>Third C.</i> Well, Mr. Wheedler, you're not going to defend
<i>that</i>, I hope?</p>

<p class="pi"><i>Mr. W.</i> I'm not prepared to deny that it is silly&mdash;<i>very</i>
silly&mdash;but hardly&mdash;er&mdash;vulgar, I should have thought?</p>

<p class="pi"><i>Third C.</i> That is a question of taste, which we won't

<p class="pi"><i>The Ch.</i> (<i>blandly</i>). Allow me. How would <i>this</i> do for the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>
second line? "She had a collapsible cup." A good many
people <i>do</i> carry them. I have one myself. Is that all of
your Ballad, Mr. Wheedler?</p>

<p class="pi"><i>Mr. W.</i> (<i>with great relief.</i>) That <i>is</i> all, Sir.</p>
<blockquote><p class="right">[<i>Censors withdraw, to consider the question.</i></p></blockquote>

<p class="pi"><i>The Ch.</i> (<i>after consultation with colleagues</i>). We have
carefully considered this song, and we are all reluctantly of
opinion that we cannot, consistently with our duty, recommend
the Council to license it&mdash;even with the alterations my
colleagues and myself have gone somewhat out of our way to
suggest. The whole subject is too dangerous for a hall in
which young persons of both sexes are likely to be found
assembled; and the absence of any distinct assertion that the
young couple&mdash;Molly and&mdash;ah&mdash;the gentleman who narrates
the experience&mdash;are betrothed, or that their attachment is, in
any way, sanctioned by their parents or guardians, is quite
fatal. If we have another Ballad of a similar character
from the same quarter, Mr. Wheedler, I feel bound to warn
you that we may possibly consider it necessary to advise that
the poet's licence should be cancelled altogether.</p>

<p class="pi"><i>Mr. W.</i> I will take care to mention it to my client, Sir. I
understand it is his intention to confine himself to writing
Gaiety burlesques in future.</p>

<p class="pi"><i>The Ch.</i> A very laudable resolution! I hope he will keep
it.      <span class="p2">[<i>Scene closes in.</i></span></p>


<p class="top4">It is hardly possible that any Music-hall Manager
or vocalist, irreproachable as he may hitherto have
considered himself, can have taken this glimpse into
a not very remote futurity without symptoms of uneasiness,
if not of positive dismay. He will reflect
that the ballad of "Molly and I," however repre<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span>hensible
it may appear in the fierce light of an L. C.
C. Committee Room, is innocuous, and even moral,
compared to the ditties in his own <i>répertoire</i>. How,
then, can he hope, when his hour of trial strikes, to
confront the ordeal with an unruffled shirt-front, or a
collar that shall retain the inflexibility of conscious
innocence? And he will wish then that he
had confined himself to the effusions of a bard
who could not be blamed by the most censorious
moralist.</p>

<p>Here, if he will only accept the warning in time,
is his best safeguard. He has only to buy this little
volume, and inform his inquisitors that the songs
and business with which he proposes to entertain an
ingenuous public are derived from the immaculate
pages of Mr. Punch. Whereupon censure will be
instantly disarmed and criticism give place to congratulation.
It is just possible, to be sure, that this
somewhat confident prediction smacks rather of the
Poet than the Seer, and that even the entertainment
supplied by Mr. Punch's Music Hall may, to the
Purist's eye, present features as suggestive as a
horrid vulgar clown, or as shocking as a butterfly,
an insect notorious for its frivolity. But then,
so might the "songs and business" of the performing
canary, or the innocent sprightliness of the
educated flea, with its superfluity of legs, all<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>
absolutely unclad. At all events, the compiler of
this collection ventures to hope that, whether it is
fortunate enough to find favour or not with Music-hall
"artistes," literary critics, and London County
Councilmen, it contains nothing particularly objectionable
to the rest of the British Public. And
very likely, even in this modest aspiration, he is
over-sanguine, and his little joke will be taken
seriously. Earnestness is so alarmingly on the increase
in these days.</p>

under all its sentiment&mdash;has been specially designed to
harmonise with the recently altered tone of Music-hall
audiences, in which a spirit of enlightened Radicalism is at

metre, the verses will satisfy the requirements of this most

<p class="top4">This song, if sung with any spirit, should, <i>Mr. Punch</i>
thinks, cause a positive <i>furore</i> in any truly patriotic gathering,
and possibly go some way towards influencing the
decision of the country, and consequently the fate of the
Empire, in the next General Elections. In the meantime it
is at the service of any Champion Music Hall Comique who
is capable of appreciating it.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">In</span> most respects, no doubt,
the present example can
boast no superiority to ditties
in the same style now
commanding the ear of the
public. One merit, however,
its author does claim
for it. Though it deals with
most of the burning questions
of the hour, it can be
sung anywhere with absolute
security. This is due to a
simple but ingenious method
by which the political sentiment
has been arranged on
the reversible principle. A
little alteration here and
there will put the singer in
close touch with an audience
of almost any shade of politics.
Should it happen that
the title has been already
anticipated, <i>Mr. Punch</i> begs
to explain that the remainder
of this sparkling composition is entirely original; any<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>
similarity with previous works must be put down entirely

of a Music-hall audience. Our example, which is founded
upon the very best precedents, derives an additional piquancy
from the social position of the beloved object. Cultivated
readers are requested not to shudder at the rhymes. <i>Mr.

<p><span class="smcap">Any</span> ditty which accurately reflects the habits and amusements
of the people is a valuable human document&mdash;a fact that
probably accounts for the welcome which songs in the
following style invariably receive from Music-hall audiences
generally. If&mdash;<i>Mr. Punch</i> presumes&mdash;they conceived such
pictures of their manner of spending a holiday to be unjustly
or incorrectly drawn in any way, they would protest strongly
against being so grossly misrepresented. As they do nothing
of the sort, no apology can be needed for the following
effusion, which several ladies now adorning the Music-hall
stage could be trusted to render with immense effect. The
singer should be young and charming, and attired as simply
as possible. Simplicity of attire imparts additional piquancy
to the words:&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> "Duet and Dance" form so important a feature in
Music-hall entertainments, that they could hardly, with any
propriety, be neglected in a model compilation such as <i>Mr.
Punch's</i>, and it is possible that he may offer more than one
example of this blameless diversion. For some reason or
other, the habit of singing in pairs would seem to induce a
pessimistic tone of mind in most Music-hall <i>artistes</i>, and&mdash;why,
<i>Mr. Punch</i> does not pretend to say&mdash;this cynicism is
always more marked when the performers are of the softer
sex. Our present study is intended to fulfil the requirements
of the most confirmed female sceptic, and, though the
Message of the Music Halls may have been given worthier and
fuller expression by pens more practised in such compositions,
<i>Mr. Punch</i> is still modestly confident that this ditty, with all
its shortcomings, can be sung in any Music Hall in the
Metropolis without exciting any sentiment other than entire
approval of the teaching it conveys. One drawback, indeed,
it has, but that concerns the performers alone. For the sake
of affording contrast and relief, it was thought expedient that
one of the fair duettists should profess an optimism which
may&mdash;perhaps must&mdash;tend to impair her popularity. A conscientious
<i>artiste</i> may legitimately object, for the sake of her
professional reputation, to present herself in so humiliating a
character as that of an <i>ingénue</i>, and a female "Juggins";<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span>
and it does seem as if the Cynical Sister must inevitably
monopolise the sympathies of an enlightened audience.
However, this difficulty is less formidable than it appears; it
should be easy for the Unsophisticated Sister to convey a
subtle suggestion here and there, possibly in the incidental
dance between the verses, that she is not really inferior to her
partner in smartness and knowledge of the world. But
perhaps it would be the fairest arrangement if the Sisters
could agree to alternate so ungrateful a <i>rôle.</i></p>

passion in a rakish and knowing spirit, he is apt to exhibit an
unworldliness truly ideal in its noble indifference to all social
distinctions. So amiable a tendency deserves encouragement,
and <i>Mr. Punch</i> has much pleasure in offering the following
little idyl to the notice of any Mammoth Comique who may
happen to be in a sentimental mood. It is supposed to be
sung by a scion of the nobility, and the <i>artiste</i> will accordingly
present himself in a brown "billy-cock" hat, a long grey
frock-coat, fawn-coloured trousers, white "spats," and primrose,

<p><span class="smcap">A Music-hall</span> audience will always be exceedingly susceptible
to pathos&mdash;so long as they clearly understand that the
song is not intended to be of a comic nature. However, there
is very little danger of any misapprehension in the case of our
present example, which is as natural and affecting a little
song as any that have been moving the Music Halls of late.
The ultra-fastidious may possibly be repelled by what they
would term the vulgarity of the title,&mdash;"The Night-light
Ever Burning by the Bed"&mdash;but, although it is true that this
humble luminary is now more generally called a "Fairy
Lamp," persons of true taste and refinement will prefer the
homely simplicity of its earlier name. The song only contains
three verses, which is the regulation allowance for
Music-hall pathos, the authors probably feeling that the
audience could not stand any more. It should be explained
that the "tum-tum" at the end of certain lines is not intended
to be sung&mdash;it is merely an indication to the orchestra
to pinch their violins in a <i>pizzicato</i> manner. The singer
should either come on as a serious black man&mdash;for burnt cork
is a marvellous provocative of pathos&mdash;or as his ordinary self.
In either case he should wear evening dress, with a large
brilliant on each hand.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span></p>

<h2><a name="XIII_THE_MILITARY_IMPERSONATOR" id="XIII_THE_MILITARY_IMPERSONATOR"></a><span class="smcap">xiii.</span>&mdash;THE MILITARY IMPERSONATOR.</h2>


<p><span class="smcap">To</span> be a successful Military Impersonator, the principal
requisite is a uniform, which may be purchased for a moderate
sum, second-hand, in the neighbourhood of almost any
barracks. Some slight acquaintance with the sword exercise
and elementary drill is useful, though not absolutely essential.
Furnished with these, together with a few commanding
attitudes, and a song possessing a spirited, martial refrain,
the Military Impersonator may be certain of an instant and
striking success upon the Music-hall stage,&mdash;especially if he
will condescend to avail himself of the ballad provided by <i>Mr.
Punch</i>, as a vehicle for his peculiar talent. And&mdash;though we
say it ourselves&mdash;it is a very nice ballad, to which Mr.
McDougall himself would find it difficult to take exception.
It is in three verses, too&mdash;the limit understood to be formally
approved by the London County Council for such productions.
It may be, indeed, that (save so far as the last verse
illustrates the heroism of our troops in action&mdash;a heroism too
real and too splendid to be rendered ridiculous, even by
Military Impersonators), the song does <i>not</i> convey a particularly
accurate notion of the manner and pursuits of an
officer in the Guards. But then no Music-hall ditty can ever
be accepted as a quite infallible authority upon any social type
it may undertake to depict&mdash;with the single exception,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span>
perhaps, of the Common (or Howling) Cad. So that any
lack of actuality here will be rather a merit than a blemish in
the eyes of an indulgent audience. Having said so much, we
will proceed to our ballad, which is called,&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">This</span> Drama, which, like our last, has been suggested by a
poem of the Misses Taylor, will be found most striking and
impressive in representation upon the Music-hall stage. The
dramatist has ventured to depart somewhat from the letter,
though not the spirit, of the original text, in his desire to
enforce the moral to the fullest possible extent. Our present
piece is intended to teach the great lesson that an inevitable
Nemesis attends apple-stealing in this world, and that Doom
cannot be disarmed by the intercession of the evil-doer's
friends, however well-meaning.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Our</span> present example is pure tragedy of the most ambitious
kind, and is, perhaps, a little in advance of the taste of a
Music-hall audience of the present day. When the fusion
between the Theatres and the Music Halls is complete&mdash;when
Miss Bessie Bellwood sings "<i>What Cheer, 'Ria?</i>" at the
Lyceum, and Mr. Henry Irving gives his compressed version
of <i>Hamlet</i> at the Trocadero; when there is a general levelling-up
of culture, and removal of prejudice&mdash;then, and not till
then, will this powerful little play meet with the appreciation
which is its due. The main idea is suggested by the Misses
Taylor's well-known poem, <i>The Pin</i>, though the dramatist
has gone further than the poetess in working out the notion
of Nemesis.</p>

it's me&mdash;little Elfie, come all the way from Australia to see
you, because I thought you must be sow lownly all by yourself!
My Papa often told me what a long score he owed you,
and how he hoped to pay you off if he lived. But he went
out to business one day&mdash;Pa was a bushranger, you know, and
worked&mdash;oh, <i>so</i> hard; and never came back to his little Elfie,
so poor little Elfie has come to live with you!</p>

<p class="pi"><i>Monks.</i> Will you have the child removed now, my Lady?</p>

<p class="pi"><i>Lady B.</i> (<i>undecidedly</i>). Not now&mdash;not yet; I have other
work for you. These Christmas gifts, to be distributed
amongst my good friends and neighbours (<i>handing parcels</i>).
First, this bundle of cigars to Sir Vevey Long with my best
wishes that such a connoisseur in tobacco may find them
sufficiently strong. The salve for Lady Violet Powdray, with
my love, and it should be rubbed on the last thing at night.
The plant you will take to the little Pergaments&mdash;'twill serve
them for a Christmas tree. This packet to be diluted in a
barrel of beer, which you will see broached upon the village
green; these sweetmeats for distribution among the most
deserving of the school-children.</p>

<p class="pi"><i>Elfie</i> (<i>throwing her arms around Lady B.'s neck</i>). I <i>do</i> like
you, Grandma, you have such a kind face! And oh, what pains
you must have taken to find something that will do for
everybody!</p>

<p class="pi"><i>Lady B.</i> (<i>disengaging herself peevishly</i>). Yes, yes, child.
I trust that what I have chosen will indeed do for <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[123]</a></span>everybody,&mdash;but
I do not like to be messed about. Monkshood, you
know what you have to do.</p>

<p class="pi"><i>Elfie.</i> Oh, I am sure he does, Grandma! See how
benevolently he smiles. You're such a good old man, you
will take care that all the poor people are fed, <i>won't</i> you?</p>

Speak low&mdash;I would not that yonder child should awake and

<p class="pi"><i>Little Elfie</i> (<i>behind the screen, very wide awake indeed</i>).
Dear, good old Grannie&mdash;she would conceal her generosity&mdash;even
from <i>me</i>! (<i>Loudly.</i>) She little thinks that I am overhearing
all!</p>

<p class="pi"><i>Monks.</i> I could have sworn I heard whispering.</p>

<p class="pi"><i>Lady B.</i> Nay, you are mistaken&mdash;'twas but the wind in

that innocent child; but old and attached servant as he is,
there are liberties I still know how to forbid. (<i>To</i> M.) Your
story&mdash;quick!</p>

<p class="pi"><i>Monks.</i> First, I delivered the cigars to Sir Vevey Long,
whom I found under his verandah. He seemed surprised and
gratified by the gift, selected a weed, and was proceeding to
light it, whilst he showed a desire to converse familiarly with
me. 'Astily excusing myself, I drove away, when&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p class="pi"><i>Lady B.</i> When <i>what</i>? Do not torture a wretched old
woman!</p>

<p class="pi"><i>Monks.</i> When I heard a loud report behind me, and, in
the portion of a brace, two waistcoat-buttons, and half a
slipper, which hurtled past my ears, I recognised all that was
mortal of the late Sir Vevey. You mixed them cigars uncommon
strong, m'Lady.</p>

<p class="pi"><i>Elfie</i> (<i>aside</i>). Can it be? But no, no. I will <i>not</i> believe
it. I am sure that dear Granny meant no harm!</p>

<p class="pi"><i>Lady B.</i> (<i>with a grim pride she cannot wholly repress</i>). I
have devoted some study to the subject of explosives. 'Tis
another triumph to the Anti-tobacconists. And what of Lady
Violet Powdray&mdash;did she apply the salve?</p>

<p class="pi"><i>Monks.</i> Judging from the 'eartrending 'owls which proceeded
from Carmine Cottage, the salve was producing the
desired result. Her Ladyship, 'owever, terminated her suffer<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[127]</a></span>ings
somewhat prematoor by jumping out of a top winder just

<p class="pi"><i>Lady B.</i> She should have died hereafter&mdash;but no matter ... and
the Upas-tree?&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p class="pi"><i>Monks.</i>&mdash;&mdash;was presented to the Pergaments, who unpacked
it, and loaded its branches with toys and tapers; after
which Mr. Pergament, Mrs. P., and all the little Pergaments
joined 'ands, and danced round it in light'arted glee. (<i>In a
sombre tone.</i>) They little knoo as how it was their dance of
death!</p>

<p class="pi"><i>Lady B.</i> That knowledge will come! And the beer,
Monkshood&mdash;you saw it broached?</p>

<p class="pi"><i>Monks.</i> Upon the village green; the mortality is still
spreading, it being found impossible to undo the knots in
which the victims have tied themselves. The sweetmeats
were likewise distributed, and the floor of the hinfant-school
now resembles one vast fly-paper.</p>

<p class="pi"><i>Lady B.</i> (<i>with a touch of remorse</i>). The children too!
Was not my little Elfie once an infant? Ah me, ah
me!</p>

<p class="pi"><i>Elfie</i> (<i>aside</i>). Once&mdash;but that was long, long ago. And,
oh, <i>how</i> disappointed I am in poor dear Grandmama!</p>

<p class="pi"><i>Lady B.</i> Monkshood, you should not have done these
things&mdash;you should have saved me from myself. You <i>must</i>
have known how greatly all this would increase my unpopularity
in the neighbourhood.</p>

<p class="pi"><i>Monks.</i> (<i>sulkily</i>). And this is my reward for obeying
orders! Take care, my Lady. It suits you now to throw
me aside like a&mdash;(<i>casting about for an original simile</i>)&mdash;like
a old glove, because this innocent grandchild of yours has
touched your flinty 'art. But where will <i>you</i> be when she
learns&mdash;&mdash;?</p>

<p class="pi"><i>Lady B.</i> (<i>in agony</i>). Ah, no, Monkshood, good, faithful<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[128]</a></span>
Monkshood, she must never know that! Think, Monkshood,
you would not tell her that the Grandmother to whom she
looks up with such touching, childlike love, was a&mdash;<i>homicide</i>&mdash;you
would not do that?</p>

<p class="pi"><i>Monks.</i> Some would say even 'omicide was not too black

<span class="p1">I</span> might tell Miss Elfie how you've blowed up a live Baronet,

pison in a variety of forms about this smiling village; and, if
that don't inspire her with distrust, I don't know the nature
of children, that's all! I might tell her, I say, and, if I'm to
keep my mouth shut, I shall expect it to be considered in my
wages.</p>

mended, it will fall on somebody's head, and perhaps kill
him!</p>

<p class="pi"><i>Sir P.</i> (<i>absently</i>). Yes&mdash;yes, it shall be attended to; but
leave us, my child, go. Bleshugh, this&mdash;er&mdash;gentleman and
I have business of importance to discuss.</p>

<p class="pi"><i>Spiker.</i> Oh, a mere nothing. (<i>Takes out a cigar.</i>) Got a
light about you? Thanks. Perhaps you don't recollect
twenty-seven years ago this very day, travelling from Edgware
Road to Baker Street, by the Underground Railway?</p>

<p class="pi"><i>Sir P.</i> Perfectly; it was my thirteenth birthday, and I
celebrated the event by a visit to Madame Tussaud's.</p>

</div>

<p class="pi"><i>Spiker.</i> Exactly; it was your thirteenth birthday, and you
travelled second-class with a half-ticket&mdash;(<i>meaningly</i>)&mdash;on
your thirteenth birthday.</p>

<p class="pi"><i>Sir P.</i> (<i>terribly agitated</i>). Fiend that you are, how came
you to learn this?</p>

<p class="pi"><i>Spiker.</i> Very simple. I was at that time in the temporary
position of ticket-collector at Baker Street. In the exuber<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[142]</a></span>ance
of boyhood, you cheeked me. I swore to be even with
you some day.</p>

<p class="pi"><i>Sir P.</i> Even if&mdash;if your accusation were well-founded, how
are you going to prove it?</p>

<p class="pi"><i>Sp.</i> Oh, that's easy! I preserved the half-ticket, on the
chance that I should require it as evidence hereafter.</p>

<p class="pi"><i>Sir P.</i> (<i>aside</i>). And so the one error of an otherwise
blameless boyhood has found me out&mdash;at last! (<i>To</i> <span class="smcap">Spiker</span>.) I
fear you not; my crime&mdash;if crime indeed it was&mdash;is surely condoned
by twenty-seven long years of unimpeachable integrity!</p>

<p class="pi"><i>Sp.</i> Bye-laws are Bye-laws, old Buck! there's no Statute
of Limitations in criminal offences that ever <i>I</i> heard of!
Nothing can alter the fact that you, being turned thirteen,
obtained a half-ticket by a false representation that you were
under age. A line from me, even now, denouncing you to the
Traffic Superintendent, and I'm very much afraid&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p class="pi"><i>Sir P.</i> (<i>writhing</i>). Spiker, my&mdash;my dear friend, you won't
do that&mdash;you won't expose me? Think of my age, my position,
my daughter!</p>

<p class="pi"><i>Sp.</i> Ah, now you've touched the right chord! I <i>was</i> thinking
of your daughter&mdash;a nice lady-like gal&mdash;I don't mind telling
you she fetched me, Sir, at the first glance. Give me her
hand, and I burn the compromising half-ticket before your
eyes on our return from church after the wedding. Come,
that's a fair offer!</p>

<p class="pi"><i>Sir P.</i> (<i>indignantly</i>). My child, the ripening apple of my
failing eye, to be sacrificed to a blackmailing blackguard like
you! Never while I live!</p>

<p class="pi"><i>Sp.</i> Just as you please; and, if you will kindly oblige me
with writing materials, I will just drop a line to the Traffic
Superintendent&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p class="pi"><i>Sir P.</i> (<i>hoarsely</i>). No, no; not <i>that</i>.... Wait, listen; I&mdash;I
will speak to my daughter. I promise nothing; but if her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[143]</a></span>
heart is still her own to give, she may, (mind, I do not say
she <i>will</i>,) be induced to link her lot to yours, though I
shall not attempt to influence her in any way&mdash;in <i>any</i> way.</p>

<p class="pi"><i>Sp.</i> Well, you know your own business best, old Cockalorum.
Here comes the young lady, so I'll leave you to
manage this delicate affair alone. Ta-ta. I shan't be far off.</p>

<blockquote><p class="right pim">[<i>Swaggers insolently out as</i> <span class="smcap">Verb.</span> <i>enters.</i></p></blockquote>

<p class="pi"><i>Sir P.</i> My child, I have just received an offer for your
hand. I know not if you will consent?</p>

<p class="pi"><i>Verb.</i> I can guess who has made that offer, and why. I
consent with all my heart, dear Papa.</p>

<p class="pi"><i>Sir P.</i> Can I trust my ears! You consent? Noble girl!</p>

<blockquote><p class="right pim">[<i>He embraces her.</i></p></blockquote>

<p class="pi"><i>Verb.</i> I was quite sure dear Bleshugh meant to speak, and
I <i>do</i> love him very much.</p>

<p class="pi"><i>Sir P.</i> (<i>starting</i>). It is not Lord Bleshugh, my child, but
Mr. Samuel Spiker, the gentleman (for he is at heart a gentleman)
whom I introduced to you just now.</p>

<p class="pi"><i>Verb.</i> I have seen so little of him, Papa, I cannot love him&mdash;you
must really excuse me!</p>

<p class="pi"><i>Sir P.</i> Ah, but you will, my darling, you <i>will</i>&mdash;I know
your unselfish nature&mdash;you will, to save your poor old dad
from a terrible disgrace ... yes, <i>disgrace</i>, listen! Twenty-seven
years ago&mdash;(<i>he tells her all</i>). Verbena, at this very
moment, there is a subscription on foot in the county to
present me with my photograph, done by an itinerant photographer
of the highest eminence, and framed and glazed ready
for hanging. Is that photograph never to know the nail
which even now awaits it? Can you not surrender a passing
girlish fancy, to spare your fond old father's fame? Mr.
Spiker is peculiar, perhaps, in many ways&mdash;not quite of our
<i>monde</i>&mdash;but he loves you sincerely, my child, and that is in
itself a recommendation. Ah, I see&mdash;my prayers are vain<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[144]</a></span>
... be happy, then. As for me, let the police come&mdash;I am
ready!       <span class="p2">[<i>Weeps.</i></span></p>

of this little piece

is intended to teach,

that it is not always prudent to take a hint: again, that
constructive murder is distinctly reprehensible, and should

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions
will be renamed.

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.



*** START: FULL LICENSE ***

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License (available with this file or online at
http://gutenberg.org/license).


Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with
almost no restrictions whatsoever.  You may copy it, give it away or
re-use it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included
with this eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

1.E.4.  Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5.  Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any
word processing or hypertext form.  However, if you provide access to or
distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format other than
"Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official version
posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.org),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a
copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means of obtaining a copy upon
request, of the work in its original "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other
form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7.  Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8.  You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works provided
that

- You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
